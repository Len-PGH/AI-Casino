Signalwire SWML Casino Games

## Intro
Len Graham's AI-Casino examples for Signalwire ML(SWML). These are a few fun examples of the power of Signalwire + AI.  All examples are a caller calling a Signalwire phone number.  Each number is pointed to what we call a bin.  The bin is what holds the json example.  When writing a bot, a good mindset to have is like listening to a baseball game on the radio and how the anouncer describes what's happening in the game.  Then test, fine tune and repeat.

## Blackjack
A favorite Casino game of mine. The json structure has different sections. Most of the magic happens in the `prompt -> text` section. Here we define exactly what we want the bot to do.  This can take time to fine tune as what you think you instruct might have an odd response.  The fun part is you can imagine what you want the bot to do, describe in detail as a sentence and click save.
